	* Release 1.0.

	* This release contains my "CGI::EventCountFile 1.01" module which was
previously a part of my "libdwg" distribution, but I have set it off on its own
for those of you who only want to use this and not the other modules.

	* This module contains complete POD within it.
	
	* This module requires Perl version 5.004.
	
	* There was a minor POD correction, but no version increase was made.

CGI::EventCountFile 1.01, was released.

	* CGI::EventCountFile updated to version 1.01 from 1.0 because a new method,
delete_all_keys(), was added.  Minor change to "synopsis" POD as well.

	* Began development on the final version of this module.  It was an almost
complete rewrite.
	
	* Module based on a template created by h2xs 1.18.

1999-07-29 thru 1999-11-13

	* Worked on second prototype of code that ended up in this module.  Mostly
just a code copy into a new template.

1999-03 thru 1999-05

	* Created first prototype of this module and used it to track usage on my web
sites for a year.  Many features of final version 1.0 were present.
