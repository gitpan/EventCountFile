                     EVENT COUNT FILE
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This distribution is now dead.  The modules that were in it have evolved and been
moved into other distributions where they fit better.  Some have new names.  Some
have split into several modules, and some modules have been absorbed into others.

The only reason that this file and its enclosing distribution exists is to blot
out as much as possible the details of what this distribution was, due to the
fact that listings are never deleted from search.cpan.org, but can only be
covered up by newer versions.  If it is possible to delete distributions from the
listings, then this document will no longer be necessary.

Please look to the following distributions for the modules you seek.  The details
shown here are current as of 2001 March 14th.
